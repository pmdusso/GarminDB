| running | 12 | 99.5 km | 10.6 h | 6.2 |

### Insights

#### ⚠️ Training Volume Spike

Weekly training load decreased by 42%. Rapid changes above 20% increase injury risk.

**Recommendations:**
- Limit weekly load increases to 10% or less
- Include rest days between high-intensity sessions

#### ⚠️ Lack of Base Training

Only 43% of your training is low-intensity. You are spending too much time in the 'moderate' zone, which can lead to stagnation without building a strong aerobic base.

**Recommendations:**
- Increase the proportion of easy (Zone 2) sessions
- Focus on consistency over intensity for a few weeks
- Target an 80/20 intensity distribution
